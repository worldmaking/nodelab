  <h3>Replication</h3>

  <p>The application uses a client-server architecture over WebSocket connections to synchronize information about users 
  in the shared environment, and the editable geometry of that shared environment.  These two channels of information
  use different replication strategies:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><b>User data</b> like avatar position and pose are transmitted eagerly from client to server
        30 times per second, and the server in turn broadcasts the set of last known poses to all clients
        in the room at a similar rate. These poses are then interpolated for smoother animated display.</p>
      <p>This data is one-way and ephemeral. A client may report changes only to their own user data, and
        they are considered authoritative over it. Only the latest snapshot of the data is retained in memory,
        and is cleared when a user disconnects.
      </p></li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Shared scene data</b> like the geometry, materials, and transformations of 3D objects in the world,
        are maintained in a syncrhonized document through the use of the 
      <a href="https://github.com/automerge/automerge" title="Automerge GitHub Repository">Automerge</a> library.</p>
      <p>This handles merging concurrent changes made to the scene by multiple users, and resolving conflicts
        so that all users eventually agree on the same state of the shared 3D scene. It also retains a full
        history of the changes made, so that the scene can be restored to previous versions or the edit sequence re-played.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
